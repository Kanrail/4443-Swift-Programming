#### Due Sunday the 15th by Midnight

- Must be uploaded into your github repository.
- This is the first "tutorial" in iOS Apprentice Chapter 1

- Since we have spent time on the actual language semantics, and I haven't really assigned a "program" until just recently, I think this will be a good starter. 
- I will move the due date of Program_1 (actually the second one now) and make it due Feb 23<sup>rd</sup> by class time.
